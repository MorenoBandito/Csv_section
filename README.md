Used: Python and Windows

Purpose:

I created two .py scripts one for Python 2[lcsv_parser] and Python 3[Csv_parser].
Each script will parse through the csv given[20170425_] and place the new csv in your current directory.

I found a solution to the previous disarranged csv that would aid the lead hardware engineer and output the
data he requested.


Input: Filename of given Csv

Output: New Csv
